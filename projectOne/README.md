# Description and Inspiration #

<p>Quotes Caf√© is a virtual bookstore cafe where users can read books digitally while enjoying the ambience of being at a cafe. This idea was inspired by one of my favorite activities - sitting in a well designed caf√© and reading books while caffeinated with good coffee üôÇ</p>

<p>Here are some of my sketches of the blacksmith caf√© that I drew that further pushed me to take on this idea. I thought - what if I made this on the web? and interactable?</p>

<p>This was always one of my passion projects. I was considering taking it on for my capstone at one point - a virtual design bookstore where I researched designers, their life, work, and philosophy and presented the research through books in the site  but I put a pause on it as I found the researching process for the content of the books to be too overwhelming for the time limit I had. Since for this project, all the content can come from an external source through an API, it gave me enough time to focus my time on the design and functionings of the website without being too worried about the research. </p>

<p>All the content of the books comes from the API - ‚Äúhttps://goquotes-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/random?count=1‚Äù. The quotes are randomized under the category ‚Äúcount=1‚Äù which fetches one quote upon every call.</p>

## Design Objectives #

I wanted to design a web experience where users feel a sense of comfort. I am a huge believer that when a person *feels* good, their productivity also increases. Reading can be a really pleasant activity if you are surrounded by the right environment. I aspired to achieve that through the design of the website through: 

1. **Using a warm color palette** <br><br> I chose a light creme brown for the background, inspired by the color of a latte. I chose pastel colors to reduce the intensity, making it easier for the readers to browse through as my intention is to provoke a sense of comfort. In order to achieve that, I had to eliminate all factors that can make the experience uncomfortable. Reading is an activity that takes time - it was important for me that the design made the user feel more comfortable over time, not fatigued. 

2. **Minimal Design**<br><br>This was important to reduce the visual stimuli to the minimum - this is a key component to ensure the space feels *calm*. I tried to achieve through the use of negative space in addition to using simply poly-style objects. The challenge was achieving a minimal design while making the website function properly. In one of the user testing sessions, I got the feedback that some of the objects in the site were too small. This was a feedback given by someone with shaky hands. An intentional design choice intended to achieve the minimalistic feel of the website was also a hinderance for some users. I could imagine how people with poor eye sight could also find issue in this. To fix this issue, I think I can add a feature - a zoom in button that can increase the size of the components in the screen- which is possible as I used svgs.  

3. **Minimal Text** <br><br>I wanted the physical objects and interactions present in the screen to speak for themselves. For example, the door in the home screen - as users are familiar with doors in the real world, their first instinct is to enter the house through the door. I added a highlight feature on hover to visually indicate that the door had an interaction. The same goes for the books in the bookstore. 

4. **Incorporation of sound** <br><br> I also wanted to make use of sound to achieve the design objectives mentioned above. I added a cafe background music that played once the user entered the cafe to distinguish the two settings and indicate the start of the experience through sound. I hoped this helped build the comfortable feeling of the cafe to lift the moods of the users. I also added little sound effects such as knocking when user hovers on the door and the sound of books closing and opening to emulate the sounds in the physical space. 

5. **Bright colors on interact-able objects** <br><br> In contrast to the subdued background, I made the books brighter in color to draw the attention to them immediately. The variety of the colors in the background can help give an uplifting feel within a calming environment. I made sure the colors were still pastel to achieve consistency.

## Wireframing on Ipad #

![alt text for screen readers](https://github.com/yk1932/connectionsLab/blob/main/projectOne/documentationImages/3.png)

<p>I would have three main pages</p>

1. **The starting page:** that shows an illustrated book cafe from the outside point of view. The user clicks the door to enter the book cafe.
2. **Inside the cafe:** Once the user enters the cafe, they can select through a set of books. Books will become highlighted upon hover to indicate that the users can click on the books. 
3. **Book interface:** Once the user clicks a book, they will be able to read the content of the book.

# **Process**

## Making SVG #

To create my own visual interface, I used an svg. The svg was made using figma.

![alt text for screen readers](https://github.com/yk1932/connectionsLab/blob/main/projectOne/documentationImages/4.png)

It process helped me get a feel on the appropriate sizes before coding on the site.  

## Coding | User Interaction #

The main interaction is hovering and clicking the svgs. Every interactable svg has its own id on the html which is called in the javascript. 

**In HTML**

```html
<rect class="svgThreeBackButton" id="svgThreeBackButton" x="872" y="937" width="38" height="22" rx="9" fill="#FCFAF4" stroke="#9AC8C8" stroke-width="2"/>

```

**In JS**

```javascript
//Interaction 4: Back button on svg three leads user back to cafe

var svgThreeBackButton = document.getElementById('svgThreeBackButton');

svgThreeBackButton.addEventListener("mouseover", () =>{

svgThreeBackButton.style.fill = 'beige';

});

svgThreeBackButton.addEventListener("mouseout", () =>{

svgThreeBackButton.style.fill = '#FCFAF4';

});

svgThreeBackButton.addEventListener("click", () =>{

svgTwo.style.display = 'unset';

svgThree.style.display = 'none';

closeBook.play()

});

```

Mouse over and Mouse out is used to change the color of the svg on hover. Click is used to remove the current svg to display a new one (unset).

## Fetching API and displaying quotes in the book #

I fetched the API from goquotes API using the function we coded together in class. The challenge was inputing the text inside the svg as a text component. What I ended up doing was using multiple tspans under the text for every line of text. This was the only way to skip lines on svg. I sliced the quotes so that each line contained 40 characters. The problem with this was that some words were cut off midway. 

A potential solution would be to make the reading page png background with div components on text so that formatting the text would be much easier. 

## Responsive Web #

To make the website responsive to multiple dimensions, I used the css to set the background as shown below: 

body {
padding: 0; margin: 0;
background-color: #CCBDB1;
}

And then I made the SVG with no background to stick to the bottom of the screen with a width of a 100%. This allowed the svg to display correctly regardless of dimension. How the website looks in ipad dimensions. The problem would be that this would shrink the interactable components even smaller which further made me feel the need to implement the zoom in feature in future designs.

## Moving Forward

1. **Make multiple bookstores and diversify the content users can browse:** <br><br> I want to add different themed bookstores on the main page. For example, a cafe where users can read about architecture, cute animals, coffee, etc. Each cafe will be designed according to the theme. <br><br>
2. **Zoom-in feature:** <br><br>This feature will help users of all conditions browse the website without discomfort. <br><br>
3. **More interact-able components:**<br><br>I want to make more components interactable. For example, adding a feature where the user can choose the type of drink / dessert they want. Making the trees make sounds when hovered, snowmen smile when you hover them, add a jukebox where the user can change the background music, etc.
