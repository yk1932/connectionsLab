## Project One (02.) #

### Documentation - Yeji Kwon #

<b>Task:</b>
Create a web application that utilizes both a data set and the p5.js library (p5.js is upto you). 

### Topic Selection #

<p>For this project, I want to use the pixel API to import images from their photo database into my own website to navigate when I need inspiration when drawing. I often use google to search for inspiration, but I think having the images imported directly from a website for photographers will make my searching process easier.</p>
