<b>Task:</b>
MAKE a webpage that has at least two event-driven user interactions that are handled in a script.js file.
<p>For the previous project, I made a website showcasing my work. The design of the website was text overlayed on a gradient image that I found online. For this week’s project, I was inspired to use the javascript interactions we learnt in class to create my own gradient maker so that I can have the freedom to select my own colors for the gradients. I started with wireframing on my ipad by hand. I wanted a simple interface where users can pick three colors which will be used to create the gradient in the background.</p>

<p>I further developed the design on figma. I wanted to use a san-serif font that resembled futura to give the website a simplistic, futuristic look to the application. I also wanted to make sure the website was responsive and mobile friendly using flexbox and viewport dimensions.</p>

<p><b>Reflection</b></p>

<p>There were some changes that I have made from the original design</p>

<p>
1. Create button removed: Gradient is now created whenever the user changes one of the color inputs. This removes the extra step for the user to click the create button. The gradient is immediately updated when there is a change in any single color.
<br><br>2. Button to change the type of gradient: While researching the type of gradients available in css, I came across radial gradient which I liked alot which lead me to create a feature where the users could pick the type of gradient they wanted.
<br><br>3. The user interaction was checking whether the components have been clicked (for the button) or changed (color input). When there has been an interaction, the gradient was updated in the background.
<br><br>4. For the design, I ended up choosing a different font than futura because google fonts did not have futura. I found a similar san-serif font, by the name “Josefin Sans” in light weight.3
<br><br>5. I made the buttons transparent and enlarged the padding to give them a clear glass look that I have seen in many apps which helped create the simplistic and futuristic look I was going for*
<br><br>6. To finish it off, I added a color picking icon for the website tab.
