<b>Task:</b>
<p>To make the process of designing and coding the website more simple, we were assigned to create a wireframe prior to coding the website.</p>

<p>I used my ipad to design the general outline of the website. I was inspired to create a cover for the page which had the name of the class which contained the projects. For this one, I chose my class “Alternate Realities” from two years ago as some of my favorite projects till this day are from this class. When the user scrolls down, they can access the descriptions of each project.</p>

<p>For the background, I wanted to use grainy gradients which are in trend in web design. For the font, I wanted to use a mix of san-serif and serif to allow the user to visually distinguish between the types of text. (Ex. the title would be serif, and the body text would be san-serif)</p>

<p>After I had the general layout of the web page done, I proceeded to search for grainy gradient textures on the internet for more visual inspiration. I found a couple that I liked on non-copyright photography websites. I imported these images to figma to further develop the visuals / theme prior to coding the website.</p>

<p>I also ended up making a quick logo on figma to add to the tab of the website to give it a more complete look. I used google fonts to look for the main serif font I wanted to use. I ended up choosing “DM Serif Display” as the design really went well with the gradient background of the website. I also made the font color not a complete white but more of a tinted white for a smoother look.</p>

<p>I ended up swtiching some of the design while coding the website. I created two columns for the text for a more pleasurable reading experience. For the images, I wanted to use javascript functions to make them more interactive, which I plan on implementing for next week’s assignment. While setting up dimensions and sizes, I tried my best to use vh and vw (viewport height and viewport width) as the main dimensions to make the website responsive to different screen sizes.
</p>

<p><u>Flexbox</u> was used for the formatting of the website. Large padding was given around the body to create a margin for the entire page. Each project was a div which contained two divs inside (the project title and the project description). The project description was displayed in rows with a gap of 50px).</p>

<p>The font was imported directly from google fonts. And the styling of the components was done using classes only (not id).</p>

<p>I ended the design by integrating the logo as the icon on the top left corder of the tab and adding a footer at the bottom of the page.</p>
